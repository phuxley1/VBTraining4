    "## Conda Environments\n",
    "The Imperial HPC system is easiest to manage when you are using [conda](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/applications/conda/). Conda is a package management and virtual environment system, similar to `venv` in native python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "There are many advantages to using a package management system in python, but to explain it best, let's give an example:\n",
    "Say you are a sith lord working on two projects at the same time. You started the first one called `RotJ.py` a while back, and you were using the package `force` version 0.6. `force 0.6` contains some useful functions to make your code work, including one called `force_strength()` which took one argument, the subject you were testing. This was a massive project containing thousands of lines of code, with calls to `force_strength()` all over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on you started a new project, called `tPM.py`. Since you started on `RotJ.py`, `force` has now been updated to version 1.1, which introduced a new way to calculate `force_strength()`. Now the subject is required to have a midichlorians count passed along with the subject reference itself. This greatly speeds up calculations involving force, but it also entirely breaks anything designed to work using the old version. Here's some dummy code for the two projects, just to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RotJ.py**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "# RotJ.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import force\n",
    "from lore import luke\n",
    "\n",
    "print(force.force_strength(luke))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**tPM.py**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "# tPM.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import force\n",
    "from lore import annikin\n",
    "\n",
    "m = force.detect_midichlorians(annikin, side=\"dark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(force.force_strength(annikin, m))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we've hit a serious issue. As we updated to `force` version 1.1, `force_strength()` now takes 2 required arguments. When we run `RotJ.py` we get the following error:\n",
    "`TypeError: force.force_strength() missing 1 required positional argument: 'midichlorians'`\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we downgrade to `force` v0.6, we lose all the benefits of the new method to detect force (which was providing a 500% speedup to our code!)\n",
    "\n",

Below I've provided a few alias commands you can put in your `.bashrc`/`.bash_aliases` file to speed up your workflow. This isn't the furthest that you can take it though. For instance it'd be rather great to have just one command called `hpc` which would change what it did depending on the arguments given. Maybe you could find a way to make the command `hpc` on its own log you straight in to the cluster, whilst `hpc send path/to/file` could upload to your hpc home directory. Maybe `hpc submit` could submit a job straight from your local command line without ever requiring a login.
