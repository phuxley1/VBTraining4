# Overview to the materials

# Pre-work and set-up

### Hardware and Software

We will be using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for all data manipulation and analyses/model fitting. Any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) will do, as long as you have R (version 3.6 or higher) installed.

You may use any IDE/ GUI for R (VScode, RStudio, Emacs, etc). For most people, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a good option. Whichever one you decide to use, please make sure it is installed and test it before the workshop. We will have a channel on slack dedicated to software/hardware issues and troubleshooting.

We will also be using Zoom and Slack to facilitate the synchronous portions of the training. Please have these installed in advance. 

### Pre-requisites

We are assuming familiarity with R basics. In addition, we recommend that you do the following:

1. Go to [The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html), and read+work through the [Biological Computing in R Chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/07-R.html) up to the section on Writing R code. Of course, keep going if you want (although we will cover some similar materials here).

2. In addition / alternatively to pre-work element (1), here are some resources for brushing up on R at the end of the Intro R Chapter you can try. But there are many more resources online (e.g., this and this ) -- pick something that suits your learning style.

3. Review background on [introductory probability and statistics](activities/Stats_review.html) ([solutions to exercises](activities/Stats_review_soln.html)) 

4. Inculcate the coding Jedi inside of you - or the Sith - whatever works.


# Introduction to the VectorByte databases^[What is the difference between VectorBiTE and VectorByte? We are glad you asked! [VectorBiTE](http://vectorbite.org/) is an RCN or a research coordination network funded by a 5 year grant from the BBSRC. VectorBiTE is hosting this training as it transitions into [VectorByte](https://www.vectorbyte.org/) which is a newly funded NSF grant to establish a global open access data platform to study disease vectors. All the databases are transitioning to VectorByte but the legacy options will still be available on the VectorByte website.]

- This component will be delivered live & synchronously (with a recording to be uploaded later)
